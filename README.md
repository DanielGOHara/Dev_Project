Final Year Development Project - Computing Algorithm Visualiser (Sorting)

Languages: HTML, CSS, Javascript | Libraries: React.js, Material-UI

Using Javascript, HTML, CSS and React.js I developed a sorting algorithm visualiser which animates particular sorting algorithms showing the user how each one sorts with it also containing information on each algorithm such as its time complexity and code allowing the user to repeat the process. Additionally, features such as array size manipulation and animation speed control allow for a more interactive experience with the user crafting the sorting process to their needs. Whilst the project may come across as simple it nature it has been unknown ground for me with no prior in-depth knowledge of front-end development and throughout has allowed me to expand my skill set and learn new technologies, alongside it further cementing my algorithm knowledge.
